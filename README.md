# TMDB Movie Data Analysis

## by Chinonso Okonkwo

## Objectives

This is a repository for Udacity Data Analyst Project 1 (Investigate a Dataset).
The dataset used in the project is also included in this repository.

## Installation

The libraries used on this project include:
<br>

- Pandas – For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas functionality is built on NumPy (upgrade to version 0.25.1)<br>
- Numpy – For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations<br>
- Matplotlib – For all visualizations (including maps and graphs)


## Introduction

I analyzed the dataset which contains information of about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The analysis is focused on answering the questions:

 - Which movie title had the highest budget?
 - Which movie titles has the highest revenue?
 - Which movies are the most popular of all times?
 - Is there a correlation between vote_count and revenue?
 - What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

## Project Methodology

The main steps for this project can be summarized as follows:
<br>
- Data Wrangling
    - Data Assessment
    - Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Analysis
- Conclusions/Results

## Results

Based on the data and analysis carried out;

- The most Popular Movies of all time are Jurassic World, Mad Max: Fury Road, Interstellar, Guardians of Galaxy and Insurgent.

- The Scatter plot visualization plotted shows that there is no correlation between vote_counts and revenue generated.

- High Popularity ratings is associated with movies that generates high revenue

- The budget of a movie that generates low revenue is about 5 million while that of a high revenue movie over 52 million. This clearly shows that budget of a movie is correllated with the revenue of a movie, but there are limitations to this result, such as the year the movie was released(release_year) and Director of the Movie.
